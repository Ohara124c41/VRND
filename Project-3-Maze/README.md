## Specifications
This project was meant to create a maze with collectibles (coins) and a locked door that requires a key (collectible).

The task for the student is to demonstrate working knowledge of creating scripts, using animations, assigning audio files and implementing waypoints for movement.

The student the must build and launch the project on a smartphone.

Since I grew up on platformers, I intentionally made the game more challenging by placing coins in hard to reach/see places, making some waypoints useless and requiring the player to “glitch” through the wall to get collectibles. I also designed the level with the intention to allow the player to “speed run” through the course, once they knew the key location.
